# Why Did I Create This Project?

Recently, Python has become very popular, right?

Many people are starting to learn Python.

However, I noticed that some channels don't teach all the necessary content.

Take, for example, "Papaya Computer Classroom."

While each video is only 10–20 minutes long, the content taught isn't very comprehensive.

On the other hand, beginners often lack the patience to watch the really long instructional videos.

Therefore, I plan to create a Chinese-language module...

## ...to allow all beginners to develop their own software!

Although I'm not an expert at writing Python myself,

I do know how to write Tkinter (but I don't know Pygame).

It might not have every single feature,

but it will be sufficient for general use.
